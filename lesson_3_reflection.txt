When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  If I keep all my work local, it's hard to share it with others. When I want 
  others to contribute to my project, I will rather use a remote repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   
   By pulling changes manually, I can decide which version of  my local project
   should appear on the GitHub website, it's better to use manually pulling 
   in order that every version of my project that appear on GitHub is ready
   to use.
