When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  If I keep all my work local, it's hard to share it with others. When I want 
  others to contribute to my project, I will rather use a remote repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   
   By pulling changes manually, I can decide which version of  my local project
   should appear on the GitHub website, it's better to use manually pulling 
   in order that every version of my project that appear on GitHub is ready
   to use.

 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
 one instead of another?

    Fork is a kind of clone which happpens only at GitHub when we copy other's 
    repository to our GitHub; clones can happen between two local repositories or
    between a local repository and a GitHub repository when we copy a GitHub
    repository to local repository; branches are different workflow within a project, 
    when we do fork or clone, we copy every branches of the repository.

 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored
 locally?

     We can do that by git fetch origin, then we can use git diff to compare the local
     branch and the newest remote branch without merging them.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and
 what would be harder?

     Probably we will sit together around a table and collaborate with each other, 
     communication within the group is easier, because one can communicate with the
     other directly. However, rasing efficiency is harder especially when writing code, 
     beacuse mangaging conflicts in code is a lot more harder than using GitHub

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in 
master? What benefits does each approach have?
